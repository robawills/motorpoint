The Creative Little Neue Kit is a utilitarian, ITCSS based, super scaleable front-end framework. It's built for the modern web and only supports modern browsers, oh and IE11, all for the benefit of web users everywhere.

The kit includes a flex based fluid grid, common comprehendible Javascript plugins and a tasty minimalist style for all your friendly neighbourhood web elements.

## Requirements

This is a Sass based framework and you'll need something to compile all that sassy code. In-house we use npm scripts to watch for, check, compile, minify and display code changes fast.

All style properties are autoprefixed where required, all JavaScript code is transpiled using Babel, bundled using Rollup and minified using Uglify. Finally code changes are served to the browser whilst you develop your codebase in realtime using Browsersync.

The JavaScript setup here means you can code in whatever Babel supports and browser support for both the transpiled JavaScript and compiled CSS is based on the Browserlist array in package.json. This ensures that your JS & CSS code support the same browsers!

## Setup

To get going with the framework you can:

  * Download the latest release
  * Open terminal and `cd` to the directory
  * Then run `npm i`
  * That's it once the dependancies have installed the postinstall script will be run and you are ready to code!

In future sessions where you already have the dependancies you can just run `npm start`
